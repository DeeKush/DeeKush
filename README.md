## 💫 About Me

I’m a frontend-focused developer with a strong execution bias.  
I build real, usable web products and care more about shipping than buzzwords.

- 🔭 Working on frontend-heavy web projects, portfolio-grade products, and early-stage startup ideas
- 👯 Open to hackathons and frontend-focused collaborations where ownership matters
- 🤝 Looking for code reviews and architectural feedback on real projects
- 🌱 Learning React, backend integration, and writing cleaner, scalable frontend code
- 💬 Ask me about frontend fundamentals, project structuring, and JEE → tech transition
- ⚡ Fun fact: I approach software the same way I approached exams: eliminate noise, focus on leverage, iterate fast
